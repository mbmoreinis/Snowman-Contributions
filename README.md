# Snowman-Contributions#
This is an **Open Source simulation**. Students submit patches to code and update manually.  The current version of this repository, a fork of Snowman Code, includes patches 1 (**getAnswer** by Raihan and Alexander), 2 (**makeBlanks** by Daniel), and 8 (**add Background** by Kirsten). It displays an input box for code entry, and after 6 bad guesses displays the Wonka meme (so there are 7 guesses). 

Additional patches to apply (documented in the project) include: 
- **4. Check Backgrounds** changes background color with hue/rotate based on number of guesses. New function, new css, function call. Code and Patch by Daniel (script-dr.js)
- **11. You Lose Screen** new function moves the "You Lose" image to a new div, with a function call, a change to the parts array, and some additional CSS. Patch by Alex & Kadrian (complete: script-kr.js)
- **3. Clickable Keyboard** creates a keyboard in place of the input box. Code by Raihan, patch by Isaiah (script-is.js).
